      <p>Hello! I'm Nathan Shaw. I'm an aspiring web developer who is currently studying at UCI under their Coding Bootcamp Program.
        In the bootcamp I've been learning htmlm, css, and javascript. Throughout the program I've learned to work with multiple technologies that would help me
        become a full stack developer. Those technologies being: 
        <ul>
            <li>MySQL</li>
            <li>NoSQL</li>
            <li>Express.js</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>React</li>
            <li>and more...</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
